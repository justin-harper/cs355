    "The simplified language, SPS, has the following features of PS\n",
    "* integer constants, e.g. `123`: in python3 there is no practical limit on the size of integers\n",
    "* boolean constants, `true` and `false` (Note that the boolean constants in python are `True` and `False`)\n",
    "* name constants, e.g. `/fact`: start with a `/` and letter followed by an arbitrary sequence of letters and numbers\n",
    "* names to be looked up in the dictionary stack, e.g. `fact`: as for name constants, without the `/`\n",
    "* code constants: code between matched curly braces `{` ... `}`\n",
    "* built-in operators on numbers: `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `eq`, `lt`, `gt`\n",
    "* built-in operators on boolean values: `and`, `or`, `not`; these take boolean operands only. Anything else is an error.\n",
    "* built-in sequencing operators: `if`, `ifelse`; make sure that you understand the order of the operands on the stack. Play with ghostscript if necessary to help understand what is happening.\n",
    "* stack operators: `dup`, `exch`, `pop`\n",
    "* dictionary creation operator: `dict`; takes one operand from the operand stack, ignores it, and creates a new, empty dictionary on the operand stack\n",
    "* dictionary stack manipulation operators: `begin`, `end`. `begin` requires one dictionary operand on the operand stack; `end` has no operands.\n",
    "* name definition operator: `def`. This requires two operands, a name and a value\n",
    "* defining (using `def`) and calling functions\n",
    "* stack printing operator (prints contents of stack without changing it): `stack`\n",

    "### Operators\n",

    "The `def` operator takes two operands from the operand stack: a string (recall that strings in the operand stack represent names of postscript variables) and a value. It changes the dictionary at the hot end of the dictionary stack so that the string is mapped to the value by that dictionary. Notice that `def` does ***not*** change the number of dictionaries on the dictionary stack!\n",
